I chose to create a game in JavaFX, specifically a snake game.
The user can use all four arrow keys to try to get all of the food.
I also recognize that I didn't include multiple iterations of the game.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

Learning more about the structure of JavaFX app was interesting, and having a tanginble game to play was fun.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

It may seem obvious, but I definitely would have started earlier and tried to make the game more aesthetically pleasing. I think it was easy to separate this game into several "problems" to solve, but I definitely hit spots where I got stuck, and had to take time to think.
